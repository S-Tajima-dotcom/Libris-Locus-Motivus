<h2>Krokodil (Crocodile)  Ce 6/8 14253</h2>
</nav>
    <figure><img src="images_crocodile/CIMG1065.jpg" alt="Crocodile whole view"></figure>
    <p>
     This is one of the most famous locomotives within railroad enthusiasts. The whole body 
	 is constructed with three parts - motor hoods at both ends and main body - and they move 
	 according to the curve ; hence, called “Krokodil (crocodile)”. It was a long time ago when 
	 I first got to know (by a picture) this remarkable locomotive. My first impression was “How can it
     move with these strange rods ? ”.
	  I started modeling this one in 1987 which was the second model after a long blank from 
	 the first one - UP’s Big Boy. So, I was not sure at all if I could make it. I started making 
	 the most difficult parts - the spoked driving wheel - as a sort of experiment. And it
     turned out to be easier than I had anticipated. Then I tackled the whole locomotive 
	 taking nearly a year, without even the slightest idea that I would see the original next year.
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_crocodile/crocodile_1.jpg" alt="Crocodile side view"></figure>

	<p>
	 In 1988, I had a chance to stay in Brussels for four months by business and I went to Europe 
	 with a strong resolution to visit Erstfeld during my stay. So, my wife, my old friends and I  
	 visited Erstfeld depot where Krokodil was preserved. While I was taking pictures and inspecting 
	 the real one, my friend got a permission to actually visiting the depot itself. Inside the depot, 
	 there were some other locomotives as well as the preserved Krokodil in working order. 
	 The people at depot very kindly showed us the inside of the locomotive and several other ones, 
	 finally asked me if I would like to see something else. And I just asked if I could see the roof of 
	 the locomotive because the layout of roof equipment was never clear until the end of the modeling.
	 To my astonishment, they brought a ladder and here we were - on the roof of 14253 ( exactly 
	 the same number I modeled). To my chagrin, the layout and design of the roof was somewhat 
	 different from my assumption.
	
	 Main transformer is actually dropped from the roof and has no cover over it ( I assumed that 
	 transformer was housed in the body). High tension power cable
     was directly connected to the transformer which had
     fins for radiation as well as air grill for ventilation.
     Even that small disappointment, I had one of the
     happiest time in my life.
   	</p>
	<p>
	 There are two different series for the Krokodil. One is Series 6/8 II, the other Series 6/8 III.
	 And Series III has just a main rod and connecting rods for three driving wheels which is quite 
	 similar to conventional steam locomotives. Modeled here is, of cource,  Series II.
	</p>
	<p>
	 This model didn’t move smoothly at first because of relatively poor skill at that time of 
	 construction. Plays between
	 rods made impossible to operate smoothly to both directions, and eventually, I installed 
	 gears inside the frame. Finally it worked fine, this final modification was put
     into after ten yaers or so from the first modeling.

    <p>
     The biggest problem making this model was the scale. JNR adopts 1067mm gauge and 
	 if the gauge is scaled to 32mm, it should be 1/33 and that makes the whole model too large. 
	 Therefore, I compromised to 1/40 for body, but then the scale of the gauge is incorrect.
     Modeling itself was not difficult – nice drawings are relatively easily available, ample space 
	 for controllers and pantograph drivers. Also the driving wheels don’t have spokes. And I could 
	 refer to the original quite easily – which I didn’t. Availability of spray paint was easy as
     well. Because exactly same color used for locomotive and railway rolling stocks are sold 
	 for hobbyists.
	</p>
	<p>
	 Color scheme of this locomotive is perhaps the oldest color used for JNR electric locomotives. 
	 The color has been thought to be out of date in 60’s or 70’s, but again it revived – 
	 although not entirely the same way, that is, white line was added to give a nice accent.
    </p>

	<figure><img src="images_EF64/EF64_1.jpg" alt="EF64 side view"></figure>

	<p>
	 Each bogie has two motors and the torque is transmitted via pinion and spur gears to 
	 the wheel. Inside the body, DC/DC converter is equipped which converts 20V from the rail 
	 to 5V for logic and 8V for motor driver. Also, decoder and some logic circuit are carried
     as well. 
	</p>
	<p>
     Pantographs are motor driven. That is, two pantographs and head lights on both ends
	 can be controlled, along with the speed and direction.

     This series is one of the standard Belgian Electric locomotives and there are some

     The basic body looks quite similar with each other, but roof equipments are fairly different.

	<p>
	 Characteristic of this locomotive is the long body for Bo-Bo driving wheel arrangement, 
	 and because of that, the cab ends are slightly tapered. When I was staying in Brussels in 
	 1988, I have taken several photographs of this series among others with no particular plan 
	 of modeling. So, I didn’t realize this tapered cab ends which annoyed me when I started 
	 modeling. This point was not obvious by photographs I have taken as well as documents 
	 which contain rough drawings. But having looked into as many photographs as available 
	 very carefully, I finally got to the conclusion that the cab ends are tapered.
     Another difficulty was the arrangement of roof equipment. The roof equipment for the 
	 AC version is too complicated and I had no hope to get enough information, 
	 I have chosen DC model which was the series 27. Even then, I found some difficulties
     about the roof and my old friend in Brussels have taken some more pictures which shows 
	 the roof and, above all, acquired very good information for me.
     When I got the detailed information, I have been modeling the roof, but I removed 
	 several parts and did it again.
     </p>
	 <p>
	 Color scheme was difficult as well. I think I have the image of the color, but the problem 
	 was no good spray paint was available.
     So I used transparent blue over green paint. The result was tolerable. 
	 Interesting thing about the bogie is the symmetrically wound springs. ( See white springs 
	 supporting the body; right winding and left winding springs are used in pair.)
     Coil spring born bogies are fairly common in many locomotives as well as electric multiple 
	 units, but as far as I know, same kind of springs are usually used.
	</p>
	<p>
     Since this locomotive was one of my early models, the
     pantographs are not motor driven and head lights are just
     dummies. When it was built, the motors are controlled by DC voltage
     applied to the rail, but later it was modified to meet the current
     digital control system. But pantographs and lights remains as
     they were and hence do not move up/down nor light up.

	<p>
	 It is said that this class is now to be withdrawn in 2021.

    <p>
     This model was not so difficult to make. Relatively simple bogie with ample space in the 
	 body. The only point a bit tricky was the curves of bonnets. They were all made from 
	 0.3mm brass sheets with cutting, bending and soldering. However, one thing I was not 
	 sure was the driving wheel. I suspected that the driving wheel had spokes. And I actually asked 
	 for the information to the museum at Utrecht. But the answer was that they had no spokes 
	 and the model above was first equipped with simple disc wheels. 1988 was pre
     Internet era and I couldn’t survey more.
     But, later I found that they were spoked, and replaced with spoked wheels where 
	 the number of spokes were still uncertain, but recently, I found by the YouTube that the 
	 number of spokes were all right. A sort of joy!
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_NS/NS1200_1.jpg" alt="class 1200 side view"></figure>
	<p>
	 For this model, full control is realized. Speed and direction of the running, up/down of 
	 pantographs and on/off of head lights are controllable. At first, both pantographs can be 
	 accidentally folded down while running caused by miss interpretation of control signal.
	 (At that time, controller was made by CMOS random logic, and absolutely minimal
	 functionality was implemented.)
     Later, the controller was replaced by a microprocessor based design and the problem was 
	 basically resolved.
    </p>
	<p>
     The driving bogie has three axels with coil springs and big equalizers.
     Since the design of this locomotive was American origin, it was easier
     in referring to American locomotives to investigate the construction of
     this bogie.

     Original locomotive seemed to be built as E646 025 and was renumbered ( perhaps 
	 with some modification ) to E645 005 in early 60s. Many components were standardized and 
	 used commonly with other type of locomotives. Hence they have Bo’Bo’ version of this one
     as well ( but with single body). 
	 Older Italian locomotives always remind me “Iron mask” although I have never met him 
	 in person, nor met this locomotive. And I painted it with old livery even if many of the same 
	 class have been painted with new color scheme at the time of modelling.
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_FS/E645_1.jpg" alt="FS E645 front"></figure>

	<p>
     Unique point of this class is that the body is separated sharing the center bogie. And that gives
     this locomotive an excellent manoeuvrability. This structure is fairly common practice in 
	 Italy and I wonder that the rails of Italy are forced to have relatively steep curves.
     One of the difficulties in modeling was the flexible covering between two bodies. Eventually 
	 it was made by black paper with metal hooks which attached to both body. Another was the 
	 air intakes at the side of body. In order to make them, I made a press die by brass and it worked 
	 all right but the die was worn out just after the final pressing.
	 This locomotive has different side view which might cause trouble in modeling.
     But in this case I had a very nice drawings at hand.
	</p>
	<p>
     Inside the model, DC/DC converter, motor driver and logic circuits are installed. 
	 Each bogie has two motors which drive wheels by gear train. Pantographs are motor driven and
     they work quite satisfactorily but they were a bit oversized. I realized it later when I was watching
     about the finished model. A pity, but I have not a resolution to build it again until today.

     This locomotive is lesser known even among Pennsy railroaders. The reason I think is 
	 that the performance was not what it should have been and, hence, had relatively 
	 short life ( about 20 years ). Thus, not much information was available. Particularly, 
	 no color photos seem to be available and I knew later that the actual color was black 
	 ( by Internet ).
     I feel that this is American straight forward design -large diameter for speed, 
	 four driving wheels for tractive effort and big motors on rigid heavy chassis 
	 for good adhesive weight. All these added up to long wheel base and heavier force to 
	 tracks which certainly not was welcomed by maintenance people. If one think an 
	 alternative, one would split chassis into two like Krokodil, but then motor weight
     should be distributed to leading wheel considerably and lessens the adhesive weight. 
	 I can feel the designers’ dilemma here.

	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_L5/L5_1.jpg" alt="class L5 side view"></figure>
	<p>
	 Massive driving mechanism. If you compare the driving mechanism
     with the one used by Krokodil, you can easily notice the significance
     of the American practice.
    </p>
	<p>
	 Two center driving wheel seemed to have no flanges for the original. But, when I made 
	 them as they were, I found it was no good for running. I later added flanges to two driving 
	 wheels with quite a nice labor.
	</p>
	<p>
     Thinking about long rigid chassis and two heavy motors
     mounted fairly apart from the center, it must have
     experienced difficult manoeuvrability. And that becomes
     quite apparent when running this model.

     The original locomotive was one of the first prototypes made for the AC electrification with 
	 commercial frequency.
     By the success of this experiment, SNCF decided to use AC electrification with 50Hz quite 
	 intensively.
     Bo’Bo’ version of this series were also produced which had
     bigger power output and they were used in Northern border
     of France as well as in Luxembourg. The original CC 14000 series was a rotary converter 
	 machines. To cope eith the extra weight, Co'-Co' wheel arrangement was chosen.
	 
	 </p>
	<figure><img src="images_SNCF1/CC14_1.jpg" alt="SNCF 14000"></figure>
	<p>
	 What is significant of this locomotive is that she has almost no horizontal lines. Main 
	 chassis is constructed all by inclined structure and the bonnets at both ends have inclined 
	 lines as well. Almost only horizontal line is the small roof both for cabs and pantographs.
	 I imagine it must have required unnecessary effort in making drawings and actual 
	 manufacturing. On the other hand, the structure of bogie is simple - particularly, 
	 if compared with complicated mechanisms utilized in later locomotives of SNCF.
    </p>
	<p>
     In the model, control circuitry are housed in bonnets at both ends and center cab 
	 contains two pantograph drivers and motors.
     Pantographs are pulled by wires connected to the drivers because, obviously, there is 
	 no space under pantographs to install driving mechanisms. Since space inside the body 
	 is very limited , it is full of electronic components.

	I once encountered this locomotive during my 
	 travel from Lindau(Germany) to Zurich(Switzerland), because the line crosses
     Austria just for a short distance.	 
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 This locomotive was relatively easy to build. Wheel arrangement is
     Bo'-Bo' and can expect very stable run. Body space is enough to house
     controller. The only tricky thing was the corrugated body and roof.
     Those part were made by etched brass plate of thickness = 0.5mm.
     I don’t remember how etching resist was made, but that was most difficult.
     Etching was done by the solution of ferric chloride(FeCl3).
     </p>
	<p>
	 I suppose that the design of this one is based on the Swedish locomotive class Rc 
	 by ASEA. Side view of the body is quite similar. But the cab looks distinctly Austrian.
     As a model, it has not much impact when looking at. But the original looks terribly 
	 beautiful in Austrian scenery.
    </p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_OBB1/OBB_1044_1.jpg" alt="OBB 1044"></figure>

	<p>
     Pantogrpah is very simple in construction. Also roof equipmets are simple
	 ( as a model, something more preferable).
	 However, the louver was difficult (or cumbersome) to construct. It is beyond
	 my patience to make small square holes throughout, and thus brass wires were
	 used. But the wires were easily bent and finish was not quite satisfactory.
	</p>
	<p>
     It's a kind of pity that the lower part of the body and bogies are painted in black 
	 which makes difficult to appreciate the bogie design.
	</p>
	<p>
     Each wheel is driven by a motor via pinion and spur gears. It contains
     four small motors in total for driving. Wheels are all simple disc wheel without
	 spokes. This is another aspect that made easier to construct.
	 The pantographs are motor driven - that is, it can be controlled from
     outside. Heads lights are also turned on/off by controller. Red small
     lights ( tail light ) are LEDs.

	 Solitary experimental ELECTRIC locomotive.  Perhaps, one of the most bizarre looking 
	 locomotives ever built. 
     Fed by AC15KV, 16 2/3Hz, the locomotive converts current to DC by rotary converter 
	 which is housed in the boiler like body and drives three DC motors.    
     Design philosophy of thie locomotive is an enigma for me. 
     How the designer's superiors reacted when the drawings were presented? Hmmm...
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_OBB2/OBB1082_1.jpg" alt="OBB class 1082"></figure>
	<p>
	 It does have a steam locomotive’s look, but it is an Electric locomotive all right.　
     I had no information about the color scheme of the original locomotive, I painted green
     which were used to other Austrian locomotives in those days.
     </p>

	 <p>
     Since this locomotive has long wheel base, the first and the fifth driving 
     wheels have some side plays which is activated in accordance with the leading
     and trailing wheels.   That is, the leading wheel and the first driving wheel is
     connected mechanically so that the leading wheel change the displacement of
     the driving wheel at curves.
     It is much serious in models.  In the model above, leading wheel and the first
     driving wheel actually make a bogie and driving wheel is not driven at all.  The
     crank is free from the driving wheel inside !   Same with trailing wheel and the
     fifth driving wheel.   Only three wheels are driven and the rods at the first and
     fifth are just dummies.   However, without connecting axles between two cranks
     at both ends, it is impossible to move rods.  In order to cope with this situation,
     the first and the fifth cranks are gear driven by the neighboring cranks.
    Indeed, this model has the most complicated driving mechanism I ever made.

	 This is one of the most famous locomotives in the world.
     Designed by Raymond Loewy, it’s chic color scheme is
     quite a nice sight to see. And the performance was also
     excellent and have been working until early 1980's.
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_GG1/GG1_1.jpg" alt="PRR GG1"></figure>
	<p>
	 Some of the difficulties in modeling this were the shaping
     of body and painting. Since body has very subtle curves at
     both ends, I couldn’t finish by just one trial. I made some
     corrections after basic body was complete and I had to content
     with some flaws. Painting was difficult as well, particularly the
     converging golden lines were most difficult to draw. Not only
     converging curved lines were difficult to draw, but they were
     converging at body ends where painting by hand was tough.
     And the shape of the body end was not perfect, it was hard to
     keep consistency of lines.
    </p>

	
	
	<p>
     However, those golden lines do make this locomotive very
     beautiful - I have been painted my locomotives many times
     but I never experienced this dramatic difference a painting
     could make. I really felt a professional designers sense here.
	 However, the first GG1, 4800, the body was all rivetted which looked miserable.
	</p>
	
    
	
	<p>
     Compared with original, paintings by Amtrak in later years were just an eyesore.
     The color is called Brunswick green, but I had to use something similar.
	 </p>
	

	<p>
     Another difficult - or laborious - point was the driving wheels. 
     For the original GG1, the axle of the driving wheel has coaxial hollow shaft called quill 
	 and the quill is connected to motor via gears. And the motor is mounted on a chassis. 
	 To absorb the vertical displacement caused by the spring between wheel and chassis, 
	 the driving wheel is equipped with another coil springs among it’s spokes and the 
	 quill is connected to these springs. Thus the driving wheel has vertical freedom in the hollow 
	 shaft. For the model, this drive is almost impossible and it has only the dummy springs 
	 among the driving wheel spokes.
	 TWELVE wheels had to be made that way, I needed some nice
     resolution to tackle these kind of laborious models.
	 </p>
	<p>
	 The emblem of PRR was written by freehand. Lettering in the lower part of the body 
	 was done by instant lettering but the font was a bit different from the original.
	 
     Original has two motors for each axle, and also the model is equipped with small 12 
	 motors in total. This is American way design.
     No4935 is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania at Strasburg.

	 during her career, she has been modified very much – one door has been moved and one 
	 circular window has been filled. The model shows the days before modification.

	 Thin frames of circular windows were made by lathe and then soldered to the side body. 
	 Because it is not possible to make beautiful circular holes to thin brass sheet. Number 
	 plate at the side body was made by etched brass.
     Each bogie has two motors and the torque is transmitted via pinion and spur gears. 
	 Voltage for motor is down converted from 20V which
     is the constant supply voltage to the rail.

     Simple diamond pantograph has a cover; presumably against snow. Small holes
	 on the pantograph frame was a bit delicate work.

     Wind shield is made by smoked acrylic. This is the first time that I tried to
     bend acrylic by heating . But that was not so difficult. They were glued to
     the body by epoxy resin.

	 The most difficult part to build was the bonnets at both ends. Curves were
     made by cutting, bending and soldering as usual, but the result was not perfect.
     Another difficult thing was the painting of the markings under SJ and lettering
     of “RAPID”. They were all done by free hand using a drawing tool. When those
     marking and lettering was done, the body was held face up by special jig
     and breath holding moments lasted.

	 The original locomotive was planned for Bergen line which has steep slopes.  
	 The manufacturer was ASEA and this model is based on the
     design of Rc4 of the Swedish locomotive which is a very successive series and used in 
	 many railways, USA inclusive.  Thus, the design
     is very similar to Rc4, but differing the steeper slant of the nose to cope with snowdrifts.

	 The original has thyristor chopper controller and the output is quite respectable with 
	 very compact body.  The simplicity of the original locomotive is reflected to this model 
	 and one may think it easy to construct - which in fact is very much mistaken. In model 
	 locomotive scratch building, one of the most cumbersome point is the corrugation of the body. 
    </p>
 	<p>
     One of the features that attracts modelers eyes is the design of the driving wheel. 
	 By the look of the driving wheel, brake is applied to the side of the wheel rather than the tire. 
	</p>
	<p>
     Of this model, the color scheme was not very satisfactory.  Original color seems to 
	 be red, but not that bright red - somewhat darkish red commonly found in Nordic countries.  
	 That kind of color is hardly found in ready made spray and I chose somewhat brownish one 
      as shown, but, well, …
