	 French design ! 
     If you have a look again at CC14000, French engineers do enjoy their originality to some  
     unfathomable extent.
     The locomotive has a single motor per bogie and the power is delivered to all driving wheels
     via gear train which is the reason of short wheel base of the bogie. And this locomotive is 
	 designed to cover most of the European voltage systems - 
     although that does not imply most of the railways, because there still remains the difference 
	 of the signaling system.
	</p>
	<p>
	 The design and ambition is very respectable, but the long body, complicated mechanism 
	 and four pantographs with relatively small output were the costs paid.   
    </p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_SNCF2/CC40_1.jpg" alt="SNCF class CC40110"></figure>

	<p>
     Observe the louver beneath which are the windows for ventilation. It is easier to ignore 
	 cutting the window out and just pasting the louver, but in that case that slight darkness would
	 have been terribly difficult. 
	 In this model, the louver is made of acrylic and underneath the louver, windows are opened.  
	 Louver is painted wine red, but the inside windows are discernible by black shadow 
	 caused by dust (in the case of original) which is actually painted black from inside 
	 for the model.
     On the other hand, the original has a plaque at the center of the body and it was too
     difficult to make and has been omitted until today, and may be for good.
	</p>
	<p>
     As a model, pantographs are always the charming points for electric locomotives.  Although it 
	 is not very clear, pantographs are not identical and needed to make slightly different ways.  
	 Body has distinct corrugation for decoration or reinforcement.  
	 </p>
	<p>
     There used to be side windows open, but were covered by later modification.
     Drivers didn’t like it perhaps.

    <p>
	 Sole information of this model is obtained via Internet.  The original model has been a 
	 single prototype and never put to mass production; but the Bo'-Bo' version of this 
	 locomotive called class 240 were mass produced and well known by it’s distinctive
     front design.  The original locomotive was designed by a professional industrial 
	 designer and most singular classes among the series
     of electric locomotives produced by Czech company Skoda.  

     Sister locomotives seemed to have been derived from this one for export 
	 (to Soviet Union), but the looks were so degraded.
     Not only the design, but the color scheme completely surpassed the other 
	 locomotives run on CD.  Singularity of this model should be well recognized that no locomotives 
	 were designed by Skoda with distinction until quite recently.

    It has been in a forlorn condition for a long period, but now in display at the technical 
	museum in Pilzen.

	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_CDS/S699_1.jpg" alt="CD S699"></figure>
	<p>
	 Wide and curved front/rear windows, curved monitor windows (windows over the 
	 ventilator grille), oval door window, finish
     of the ventilator ends and white band were obviously what the designer had in his mind. 
    </p>
	<p>
     The luckiest - or motive triggering point was that the rough drawing was found on 
	 the Internet.
     Drawings, pictures with some technical data were enough to start scratch building 
	 a new model.
	</p>
	<p>
     One of the things that has been troubling me while making the model was the purpose 
	 of the tear dropped slit on the front ends.  However, at one time, I had a chance 
	 to see a picture (of during 
     construction ?) that showed it was a housing of a whistle.  
	 </p>
	<p>
     Bent windows were another difficulties.  Made of acrylic and bent applying heat .
	 May have been tried a couple of times so that they can fit.

<h2>CD 350</h2>
</nav>
    <figure><img src="images_CD2/CIMG1043.jpg" alt="CD 350 whole view"></figure>
    <p>
	 This is one of the most colorful locomotives run on the Czech railways, although 
	 there are many variations as of 2018.  The design does not look like something notable, 
	 but the philosophy of (body) design is very much apart form that of S699.   One can only 
	 imagine what happened ten years after the class 240 - the design of class 350 is obviously 
	 mechanical necessity driven.
     Corrugated body, wide area of ventilation, just cut out slanted front end and protruding 
	 head light hastily attached before it’s forgotten. 
     However, all those industrial design-less construction is completely paid off by it’s color scheme.  

	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_CD2/CD350_1.jpg" alt="CD 350"></figure>
	<p>
	 Skoda seems to have abandoned industrial design after S699 and class 240 for almost half 
	 a century and continuously produced engineer thought up locomotives untill CD class 380 in 
	 2008. CD class 380 clearly shows industrial designers’ work.  
    </p>
 	<p>
     Perhaps the most significant aspects of this class is the total asymmetrical design on both sides.
     As seen here, one side has a big air outlet upon the roof only, whereas the other side has 
	 air intake that corresponds to the other side and wide ventilation grilles near both ends.
	</p>
	<p>
     Although the body is compact, the requirement of those wide ventilation 
     capabilities may imply that the locomotive did not have very good efficiency - 
	 it has something that must be heavily cooled off.
	</p>
	<p>
     Another point of interest is in the design of pantographs.   Structure of the pantograph is 
	 so called single arm type, but the arm to control the shape in up position goes through 
	 the main lower shaft.  
    </p>
	<p>
	 As guessed, the construction of pantograph was challenging. I don't remember how I did
     it, but the result was satisfactory. Gray shape under the center of the body is the main 
     transformer (for the original locomotive).

    <p>
	 This locomotive is very famous with it’s driving mechanism called Buchli drive.  
	 Body mounted motors drive big spur gear coupled
     flexibly on the outer side of the driving wheel.  This flexible coupling is called Buchli 
	 system named after the inventor.   Though the precise principle how it works is hardly 
	 understood, it has worked successfully for a long time and proved to be reliable.  
     This picture shows non driving side. Heat radiation pipes for air compressor
	 covers half of the spoked driving wheels.     
	</p>

     The picture above shows the both sides of the locomotive. On the Buchli drive side, 
	 the pinion and spur gears are completely encased.  
     The bogie of two leading wheels is used to cope with the heavy transformer which  
	 is off centered in the body.

    <p>
	 This was one of the locomotives that has been on my waiting list for a long time.  
     Because of the part that covers the inside of the bogie, the structure of the 3 axle bogie was 
	 hard to imagine. 
     That was the reason that I was unable to model this one until 2008 waiting for ten years.  
	 Although the pictures of this locomotives are available by the Internet, the structure of the 
	 bogie is unknown until I learned that the suspension is derived from Swiss Ae-6/6.   
	</p>
	<p>
	 Once understood the structure of the bogie, I did start scratch building, although some 
	 engraved characters on the bogie were unable to reproduce due to two factors - firstly, 
	 what is written is unable to observe and secondly, even if characters are known
     I have no means to engrave.  But still, this is a point of chagrin to me. 

	</p>
	<figure><img src="images_20/SNCB20_1.jpg" alt="SNCB class 20"></figure>
	<p>
	 Pantographs and head/tail lights are all controllable.
    </p>
 	<p>
     Corner of the body are cut to make windows which makes the 
	 looks fairly different from the class 27, but I thinke the shape of the body is identical.
	 The buffers are spring loaded. 
	</p>
	<p>
     Wheels are simple discs and no spokes incorporated which makes very easy to
	 make these wheels. Just lathing and nickel plating.
	</p>
	<p>
     Because of the arrangement of the driving wheels (Co'-Co'), 
	 the silhouette looks very slender.  So many ventilation grills suggest that the locomotive
     has rheostatic control, but in fact it is controlled by thyristor.

    <p>
	 Modern locomotive to cover countries Italy, Switzerland, Austria and Germany.  
	 It is driven by three-phase asynchronous motor - squirrel cage induction motor.   
	 Thus the power from catenary is converted to variable frequency, variable voltage 
	 alternating current with conversion loss only.  
	 This is the reason that there are very small air exchange with outside.  
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_E412/E412_1.jpg" alt="FS class E412"></figure>
	<p>
	 The high maximum speed with small diameter driving wheels implies that high 
	 speed small motors are used thanks to the
     current semiconductor technology.
    </p>
  	<p>
     Color scheme is beautiful, matching with the industrially designed body line.  
	 Particularly if we compare with the livery of class
     E645, the change of generation is obvious. (However, E645 has 6 driving wheels 
	 which results better adhesion, and is still competitive in mountainous area.)
     </p>
	 <p>
     The face of the locomotive is made as a single component, maybe by FRP.
	</p>
	<p>
     Italian locomotives have their own charm - some older models with awful, forbidden 
	 attractiveness that you can’t stop gazing at, whereas the modern ones express clear 
	 designer's intention reminding that of the Czech S699.  Using corrugated
     steel to the body generally results dark gloomy image found on Soviet’s locomotives, 
	 but here the white color makes the corrugation into a symbol of light and speed.   
	 But the livery for PKP (Polish state railways) model which is identical in design, 
	 has red face instead of dark gray, the result is disastrous.

<h2>Bipolar locomotive</h2>

    <p>
	 American simplicity and brute force design. “Bipolar” refers to the driving motor structure.  
	 The armature and driving wheel are constructed as a single component and the vertical 
	 movement of the wheel/armature relative to the chassis mounted stator is solved by 
	 making the stator with only two field poles.  By this idea, the output and efficiency of 
	 the motor are surely limited.  Thus, even with a merit of no maintenance for gears, 
	 the axles required were TWELVE, much exceeding the number of wheels of the 
	 conventional electric locomotives.  Besides, for every tire wear, wheels with armature 
	 are coped with.
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_EP2/Bipolar_1.jpg" alt="Bipolar locomotive"></figure>
	<p>
	 That is one of the reasons why this locomotive have huge three piece body - center piece 
	 seems to house steam boiler for passenger car warming - though, the reason of the 
	 bonnet style body is unknown to me.  Visibility?  Then, why not cab forward design ? 
    </p>
 	<p>
     Having criticized as above, the author feels the venturous spirit of the designer 
	 (and railway company).  Maybe fundamental idea of the system surpassed anything 
	 else and left us to observe an amazing experiment.   And this was designed in 1919!   
	 Served for forty long yeas as well.  
	 </p>
	<p>
     On modeling, I tried to keep the American spirits  by driving all the driving wheels 
	 by mounting four motors, one for each set of tracks, and the driving wheels are 
	 coupled together by gear train.
    </p>
	<p>
     Another challenging factor was the number of spoked wheels to be made.  
	 It has 24 driving wheel discs with spokes. The leading simple disc wheels sound 
	 even a relief. 
     (well over three Bo-Bo locomotives ; another American way.)   
	 </p>
	<p>
	I tried to recapture American spirit by installing four motors, driving twelve 
	 driving wheels, even thogh I have no plan to haul anything in the future.

<h2>DB class E70</h2>

    <p>
	 Originally built for Bavarian railways (Bayerische EG 2 × 2/2 ) for the electrification 
	 between Salzburg - Berchtesgaden.
     Only two were built and later renumbered E7021 and E7022.  Built in 1920, and if compared with 
     the Bipolars of the Milwaukee Road, the contrast is amazing.	 
	 
	 Each bogie has a single motor which drives a disc, and the disc is coupled 
	 with two driving wheels by a triangular rod.  
 	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_E70/E70_1.jpg" alt="DB E70"></figure>
	<p>
	 Both E70 locomotives were withdrawn in1950/51, but the compact locomotive with 
	 rod motion makes a good locomotive model, thus still in circulation in modeling world.  
    </p>
	<p>
     Since this locomotive is very compact, the inside of the body is full with 
     components - two motors, control circuit and two pantograph drivers.   
     The livery is olive drab making this little machine chic. Pantograph was very

    <p>
	 Class 111 is produced to cope with the increasing traffic on Germany after the war.  
	 The traction motor is AC commutator type under 16.2/3 Hz  and this class may be 
	 considered to be the last of the conventional system.  Total of 227 units were produced 
	 and still in service as of 2018.
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_class111/DB111_3.jpg" alt="DB class 111"></figure>
	<p>
	 Compact and well balanced design were clearly recognized while modeling - balanced 
	 size of bogie and wheels, arrangement of pantographs and ventilation windows.  
	 All the components are structured as they should be.  An interesting feature(?) is 
	 that a part of the internal equipments are observable through the center clear windows.  
    </p>
  	<p>
     As of modeling, color scheme is difficult.  In this livery, the lower side blue is finished by 
	 painting transparent yellow over standard blue.

    <p>
	 This is one of the most famous Swiss made electric locomotives.  It was designed to 
	 haul increasing traffic through the Simplon tunnel and proved to be a great success.  
	 However, when introduced, it caused a heavy oscillation damaging rods and scotch 
	 yokes -  it was found that outlined triangular rod was too fragile.  After filling 
	 the triangular rods (as seen in this modell) and with 
	 another counter measures, the locomotive revealed it’s capability to full extent.
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_Be/Be_1.jpg" alt="BLS Be-5/7"></figure>
	<p>
	 Lettering is not as it should be. This is simply because of the lack of letterings.
	 (Letterings are almost always compromised.)
    </p>
  	<p>
     Since the five driving wheels are coupled with rods, manoeuvrability looks bad, 
	 but the first and fifth driving wheels form so called Klauss-Helmholz bogie with 
	 leading/trailing wheels.  By Klauss-Helmholtz wheel, the first and fifth driving 
	 wheels are given lateral movement at curves.
	<p>
     Two head lights and one tail light are installed, all of which are controllable. Observe the
	 spring for the buffer. It is visible from outside.
	 </p>
	<p>
     Roof is relatively simple because the resistors are housed inside of the body
	 and only ventilation roof is mounted on center.

	 This is a rarity.  Only two photos in black and white seem to be existing until today. 
	 Neither drawings nor information about the livery.  
	 The color in this model is the result of my total imagination. Only some dimensional 
	 data are found on books and in the Internet.  The locomotive was an experimental 
	 one and it run on the lines of Cannes, PLM (on a test line between Grasse and 
	 Mouans-Sartoux).  Even type number is unknown.
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_Al/Al_1.jpg" alt="Alioth 2BB2"></figure>
	<p>
	 One of the technical information known is that it used vertically installed motors.  
	 By the silhouette of the locomotive, the motor must have driven the first driving 
	 wheel only ( no space for motor above second driving wheel) and the power is 
	 transmitted by gear train to the second driving wheel 
	 (short wheel base of the driving wheel).
     The experiment was said to be successful, but the reason why it was abandoned is unknown.
    </p>
	<p>
     I deduced that the two pantographs are connected by a wire above each cabs, but the picture
     doesn't show this clearly. Main transformer should have been located in the body under the 
     pantograph, and the insulator under the pantogrph must have been used for that purpose.  	 
     </p>
	<p>
     Cab looks just like that of a steam locomotive. For the original model, the motors and control
     equipmets are housed in very small area.	The original experimetal locomotive was powered
     by 12,000V AC, 1Phase, 25Hz which means that the motor was a commutator type AC motor.	 
	 </p>
	<p>
     The structure obviously reminding of that of a steam locomotive. Two axles leading truck 
	 and two driving wheels make one unit, and two units are coupled back to back.
	 </p>
	
	<p>
     I know the existence of this locomotive for more than forty years, but so little 
	 information was available and structure of (the base of) pantograph held me back 
	 until 2017.  Having observed those only two available pictures (but, fortunately, 
	 a picture with better resolution is found on the Internet), I eventually came to 
	 a conclusion about the structure of pantograph and modeled it accordingly 
	 (I can neither prove correct nor incorrect).
