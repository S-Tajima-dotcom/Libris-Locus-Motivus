<h2>Controllers</h2>
</nav>

     <p>
	 The first controller was just a bipolar variable voltage DC power supply which supplied
	 somewhere around -12 to +12 V by a control lever. On the lcomotive side, only a voltage
	 regulator was installed to suit the ratings of motors equipped. No control for headlights
     or other features were realized. Since the gauge is 0, it is not very practical to make a layout 
	 to drive
	 locomotives with carriages. But this limitation did not mean that the locomotves should be
     just diplay modells (at least for me).	That was the reason that all the locomotives are
     equipped with motors and should run with reasonable speed, but not necesarrily haul 
     heavy loads even for modells like Big Boy.	 
	 
	 In around early 90's, I had ana idea to control locomotives by super imposed digital signal to the
	 power supply. Since the decoder on the locomotive side should be operating all the time,
	 it is the easiest to supply the rails with constant voltage. And the nominal voltage for easily
	 available motors are from around 5V to 12 or 15V, I decided to supply 20V to the rails. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 By simple experiment, the locmotive worked reasonably well; some mis interpretation happened,
	 but by sending signal continuously recovers the error almost instantaneously. Also, in later
	 design, the microprocessor on locomotive side can prohibit some errors, like the change of
	 direction without passing through speed zero, and the reliability increased.
	</p>
	 <p>
	 If desigend now (2021), much better protocol is easily implimented, with even wireless 
	 communication scheme. (All the modells are made by brass, there can be a problem where to
	 install the antenna.) But, well, modification of thirty one locomotives as well as the two controllers
	 are bit cumbersome task and thus, I leave them as they are.
	 
	 
	 <p/>
	 
	 
	 
	 </p>
    <figure><img src="images_controllers/Cont_2.jpg" alt="controller view"></figure>
    <p>
	 This is the first generation digital controler. Rough specification of digital controller is as follows.
	 </p>
	 <p>
     *  Address and control are sent to locomotives by amplitude modulation, which is  
	 superimposed on DC 20V power source.
    </p>
	 <p>
     *  Address is 0 to 64; 64 locomotives may be controlled on a single rail (theoretically).
    </p>
	 <p>
     *  The controller has two channels; thus two locomotives may be controlled imultaneously.
    </p>
	<p>
	 *  Controlled features are speed (eight steps), direction, head light ON/OFF for both endsDigital
	 and up/down controle of two pantographs. (This makes eight bit in total). 
     </p>
     <p>
	 The first generation was made by CMOS random logic that limited the communication protocol
	 to minimum complexity. Particularly, the PAM signal should be decoded and motors are driven
	 at the locomotive side, ICs necessary should be minimal. This controller was replaced by a second
	 generation controller.
	 </p>

	
	
	
	<p>
	 Second generation controller by microprocessor based design. The communication protocol 
	 is identical to the first generation. Because of the processing capability, detailed features
	 were improved such as the prohibition of same address for two channels. Also, made much 
	 more compact compared with the first generation controller.

    </p>
    
	
	
	<p>
     Second generation No2. The features are identical with above. The only difference being the
	 encolsure design and different kind of processor. Slightly smaller DC power output. Even more
	 compact than the above controller.
    </p>

<h2>Locomotive Control block diagram/circuit</h2>

	<p>
     The controllers above are rather old design, and not quite appropriate to discuss how they work.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 If I were to design a new version, and still adopting PAM control signals superimposed to 
	 the DC voltage, here is the idea. Please mind that I did't make the following circuit, but just 
     trying to show how I would do. Also, an oscilloscope will be necessary to debug the hardware 
	 as well as a microprocessor development kit. 
    <a href="pdfs/controler_principle.pdf"download="pdfs/controler_principle.pdf">
    <p>  </p>
    <span class="mgr-10">Block dia/circuit(52KB)<img src="images_top/PDF_32.png"></span></a>
	 
	 <h3>Protocol</h3>
	 <p>
	 For the controller side, the signals would be the conventional serial communication 
	 with a protocol something like this. 8bit data with 1 start bit, and 1 stop bit.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 HEADER+ADDRESS+DATA+CHECKSUM &nbsp;(10bitsx4=30bits =4.2mSec)
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Suppose all of them are 1 byte data, HEADER is some character of your choice, ADDRESS is
	 from 0 to 255, and DATA maybe, 3bits for speed, 1bit for direction and other 4
	 bits for your choice. Synchronization shall be established by detecting HEADER to 
	 CHECKSUM as a single packet. Since the contact between rail and wheel is not always good,
	 CHECKSUM byte shall be necessary. 
	 The speed of communication would be 9600bps and above 4 bytes are sent continually,
	 that is, if a single locomotive only is controlled, just repeat the same signal. If more than one
	 locomotives need to be controlled, then send the signal sequentially. Since it takes 4.2msec 
	 for a single locomotive, even 50
	 locomotives would consume around 0.2sec which is sufficient for each locomotives to change 
	 status.
	 </p>
	 <h3>Cotroller</h3>
	 <p>
	 Carrier frequency may be around 4MHz (there is no definitive reason) and the circuit shown 
	 should work. The magnitude of the superimposed carrier would be 0.7Vpp or about.
	 Important point is that the carrier output should not be absorbed by the output capacitance
	 of DC power supply for driver. This is the reason that the Line Filter is inserted. (Value may be
	 around 1mH; it should be enough impedance for the carrier frequency. )
	 
	 </p>
   <h3>Locomotive</h3>
	<p>
	For the locomotive side, there may be two different power voltage necessary; one for controller
	and the other for motor. Important points for the locomotive side are the inductance L and 
	diode D. Inductance L is to make the locomotive with reasonablly high impedance for the carrier
    frequency. Diode D is to prevent the locomotive side electronics destroyed when +/- is 
	mistaken which generally happens. The demodulator is tuned to the carrier frequnecy by
    variable capacitor (in practice, this is not very critical). And decoded signal is fed to the
    microprocessor. The protocol decoding is performed by the processor and it depends 
    on the protocol design. The output for this example is speed 3bits and direction 1
	bit. For the speed output, HHH is the lowest speed for this circuit diagram.
	The D/A conversion and DC voltage conversion in this circuit is NOT well designed. Bias for
	both OP amp is messed up to the final output voltage. The outputo voltage for the motor
	is regulated by a SERIES regulator for simplicity's sake. Line filter and capacitors 
	(0.1 microfarad, ceramic) are necessary to prevent noise caused by the driver motor.

<h2>Nickel plating of Brass</h2>
     <p>
      There are several solutions used for nickel plating, but "Citric acid bath" works all right.
	  The chemicals listed below should be dissolved by 1 litre pure water. Of cource, if you need
	  less solution, you just reduce the amount of chemicals keeping the proportion. 
     </p>
     <p>
     Citric acid bath
     <ul>
     <li><span class="mgl-60">Citric acid </span><span class="mgl-60"> <span class="mgl-60">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 21g/l</span> </li>
     <li><span class="mgl-60">Nickel sulfate (NiSO4 )</span><span class="mgl-60">280g/l</li>
     <li><span class="mgl-60">Nickel chloride (Nicl2 )</span><span class="mgl-60">45g/l</li>
     </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
      In actual plating, around 2V DC power source is required. Connect plus to nickel, and minus to
      the components to be plated. Warm the solution at around 30 degree Celsius. The temperature
	  may be roughly kept on desktop plating. But be sure that the target brass is well polished and
	  no grease/oill remains before nickel plating. This plain method is not for manufacturing, but 
	  it will work for hobbyists.	  
     </p>

<h2>Insulating materials</h2>
    <p>
	 Center of wheels requires insulation when power is supplied via two rails. The best material I 
	 used so far is PEEK(polyetheretherketone), and these are sold by circular rods.
	 An alternative may be POM(polyacetal) which are more widely known by Duracon or Derlin.
	 These materials are fitted by acrylic instant adhesives. Then, tapping of M4 is made without 
	 much difficulties. It is also durable, and after thirty years, it seems all right. 
	</p>
	<figure><img src="images_controllers/BLS_wheel.jpg" alt="Wheel insulation"></figure>
	<p>
	 In the above picture, the whitish ring surrounding the axle on the upper wheel is the insulator.
	 The picture shows a driving wheel of BLS Be-5/7, and the upper wheel is permanently screwed
	 to the axle by M4. The lower side wheel is fixed to the axle by an M3 countersunk screw so that
     the phase of two wheels can be adjusted.	 
	</p>
	 <p> &nbsp  </p>
<h2>Oil</h2>	 
    <p>
	 One of the disastrous mistakes is the choice of luburication oils. Plastic gears are generally
	 made by POM and using certain type of oil ( I have no clear definition which is bad) produces
	 cracks to these components after, say, five years or so.
	 Use silicone oil that is proved to be usable to plastic materials.  Also, rubber belts will be 
	 deteriorated by oil. Need to be very careful. 
	</p>
    <p> &nbsp  </p>
<h2>Urethane belt</h2>	 
    <p>
	 Urethane (the orange colored belt) is very useful to make cutom length belts. Since pullys are 
	 easy to make by a lathe,
     one may tempted to make them by brass. But urethane is corroded by brass after five years or so.
     Aluminium should be used to pullies driven by urethane belts. 
	 </p>
     <figure><img src="images_controllers/urethane_belt.jpg" alt="degraded urethane belt"></figure>
     <p>
	 The above picture shows the degraded urethane belt by continuous contact with a brass pully.
	 On the left hand side, the color has changed, and deformed permanently. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Connection of the urethane belt
	 seems to be best done by usig the tip of soldering iron.
	 </p>
	 <p> &nbsp  </p> 
	 
<h2>DC motor noise</h2>	 
    <p>
	 One of the small difficulties of commutator DC motor is the noise produced by the motor
	 in operation. Without counter measure, the noise may well cause microprocessor
	 malfunction.  
	 In order to cope with this noize, ceramic capacitor (around 0.1uF) must be solderd to 
	 the nearest point of the motor power terminal as shown in the picture. Also, use line 
	 filter between the driver output and the motor.
	 </p>
     <figure><img src="images_controllers/DC_motor.jpg" alt="DC motor noise"></figure>
     <p>
	 The above picture is an example used for GG1, and two motors are connected in series.
	 This series connection is only feasible when two motors are mechanically connected by 
	 gears (driving a single axle). 
	 </p>
