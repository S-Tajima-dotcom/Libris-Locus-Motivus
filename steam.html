<h2>Union Pasific class 4000 Big Boy</h2>

    <figure><img src="images_up/CIMG0708.jpg" alt="Big Boy overall"></figure>
    <p>
     This is the very first model of my carrier other than one or two HO modeling before.   
     And I don’t remember exactly when I started (middle of 70's I believe) or finished.
     I wanted to make this model as live steam, but because of poor design with no experience 
	 in live steaming, it didn’t work.  So, I converted
     it motor driven with battery ( because at that time, both wheels are not insulated each other ).  
	 After that, I did a big modification to convert it into electronically controllable locomotive 
	 like my other models.  Thus, it took me a long time to complete the locomotive, if it is at all completed.   
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_up/CIMG0729.jpg" alt="Big Boy engine"></figure>
	<p>
	When I got the idea to construct, I found a drawing of locomotive in a magazine 
	( or to be exact, the drawing made me try) but no drawings
    about tender.  And even having a drawing of the locomotive, I didn’t know which driving 
    bogie rotates relative to body.   I found out by
    looking at pictures ( which was not many in pre Internet days ), but the construction of tender 
	remained unknown to me for a long time.  And I made the tender
    by, perhaps, looking at some of ALCO’s locomotives carefully and thought the diameter of the
	wheel was 950mm. It later turned out to be 1027mm
    and I not only replaced the wheels of tender but remade tender chassis as well. 
  	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_up/UP4000_1.jpg" alt="Big Boy detail"></figure>
	<p>
	Even then, one thing remained unknown to me - drivers cab has closed environment,   
	that is, there are doors in the back of the cab. 
    That was totally impossible to know by photos.  Nobody ever cared about how cab’s doors 
    looked like.   It remained an enigma until
    1997 when I visited Dallas by business.  In Dallas, one Big Boy is preserved at museum.  
	And finally I got the information more than
    20 years after I got the idea to make it.
	</p>
	<p>
	The motor is actually driving the rear engine only. I did try to transmit power to the 
	front engine via universal coupling, but didn't work well and had to abondon.

    <p>
     The original has three cylinders.   So the model above has the third cylinder and 
	 the second driving wheel has a center crank. But, of cource, neither of them are 
     visible. Perhaps the axis for the second driving wheel was most difficult to make because 
	 it had a crank. However, all the wheels don’t have spokes – which is exceptional for 
	 locomotives in Britain. That was one of the reasons I tried this type. I was not
     sure that spoked driving wheel with that diameter ( about 42mm ) was feasible 
	 by my skill.  
   	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_21C/21C_01.jpg" alt="21C17 front"></figure>
	<p>
	 Above is the angle to show this locomotive’s distinctive style. Smoke 
     deflector is almost a part of body and I wonder if it worked well.
     Significance of the British locomotives is that no headlights are equipped.   
     I suspect that they drove by watching only signals at night.  ( Wasn’t that scary  ? ）
     The original color is malachite green, but that color was not available,
     and I had to content with some similar color. This colorful paint scheme
     was also one of the British traditions ( at least in the prime days of steam
     traction ).  
     Circular plate of “SOUTHERN” gives a very nice accent to otherwise black smoke box door. 
	 The plate was made by etched brass
     which was polished and covered by transparent paint – but now losing it’s color. 
  	</p>
	<p>
	 The original locomotive was designed by O.V.S.Bulleid who was an ingenious
	 and dauntless designer, incorporated many new ideas into his line of locomotive  
	 design. But observing his later designs, he might not be interested in esthetic 
     looks of the locomotives in general. So, this series might have been an exception.
	</p>
	<p>
	Tender has three wheels supported by sheet springs with single solid chassis and no equalizers
    are utilized – this is the common British practice. It is a wonder that they have run by very high 
	speed
    daily with this mechanism.  Tracks must have been terribly well maintained.
	</p>
	<p>
	The cranked driving wheel is shown above, before nickel plating/painting.
	The driving wheels were made by two pieces. Lathed brass wheel was bored with
    oval holes and then thin brass circular sheet was soldered to which another holes
    were bored.

    <p>
     Most attractive features of this locomotive are big driving wheels with thin spokes, 
     almost fragile looking bar frames through which one can see the other side, massive 
     boiler with almost invisible short chimney and Minden style smoke deflectors. 
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_01/01_1.jpg" alt="01 side view"></figure>
	<p>
	 This locomotive was one of the most complicated models I had ever built until 
	 the modeling of BR18.  
	 All the wheels are insulated with one another so that power and control signals 
	 are fed via two rails.  Bar frame was modeled as close to the original as 
	 possible with dummy sheet springs, but the trailing wheel is mounted on movable 
	 frame as opposed to the original.
     Otherwise, it was impossible to manoeuvre steep curves of r=2000mm.  
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Another thing notable when making this model was the introduction of 
	 CAD for drawings.
   	 I thought it was almost impossible to draw 
     the spoked driving wheels by hand, I bought a 486 PC with Win3.1.   
	 Win3.1 froze so often that I had  to save data in every 30 minutes or
     less, but even then, the power of CAD was very helpful.
  	</p>
	<p>
	 I tried to model bar frame and thin spokes of the driving wheels both of which 
	 show the well calculated original design.  It is a wonder that even fragile looking 
	 frames and wheels are supporting such a massive locomotive. 
     In this model, third driving wheel is motor driven and driving force to first and 
	 second wheels is transmitted via connecting rods. 
	 I feared that the rotation of the first driving wheel might not be smooth because 
	 the plays of the connecting rods  would cause phase inaccuracy from the third driving wheel.  
	 But it worked successfully after some mechanical adjustment.  
      Boiler and body are made of 0.3mm brass sheets.  
	 Frames are made of 1.5mm brass and painted black before assembly.
   	</p>
	<p>
	 Maybe the most challenging work was the manufacturing of the wheels.  It has 
	 twenty spoked discs that really require patience. After having lathed the disc, the
	 lines of spokes are scribed, drilling holes and grinding by hand piece grinder followed.
	 The material must be free-cutting brass, otherwise it is impossible to cut by 
     amateur machinist.

    <p>
     Among many type of steam locomotives, Garratt locomotive is one of the most 
	 distinctive motive power.   Continents utilized this type
     are almost  limited to Africa and Australia.   Most of the African gauge is 
	 1067mm, there is a problem of scale when modeling for 0 gauge.
     And information is very much limited.   Some pictorial books are available for 
	 African steam, but it is almost hopeless to find necessary
     dimensions let alone the drawings. So, the remained candidates were found in 
	 Australia, and Internet was at hand. I got in touch with
     New South Wales Rail Transport museum, and bought a very nice book via Internet. 
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_AD60/AD60_1.jpg" alt="AD 60 side view"></figure>
	<p>
	 AD60 – articulated D60 – may be one of the biggest Garratt locomotives, 
	 and I feared a bit of the manoeuvrability of my rails 
     with steep curves, but it worked all right.
	 </p>
	 <p>
     Some says Garratt locomotives are ugly – very unusual, that is true.  
	 But thinking about the balance of big articulated locomotives, I think 
	 Garratt is the best. Two engines can bear almost the same weight – 
	 the difficulty of Big Boys were that the front engine gets slippery -
     center of gravity moves inside when running on curves and ample space
     for boilers is available which enables to use fat efficient boilers.
  	</p>
	<p>
	 I don’t understand why Americans never used this type on their
     rails – which were not always kept in best conditions.  As the fact 
     that African rails were the largest users of  this type tells, this type
     of locomotive can manoevre worse conditioned tracks.   And faster
     express locomotives can be easier constructed compared with Mallet
     type articulation.  French made Algerian Garratt locomotive must have
     been a sight to see.  (And I eventually made this one after a long time.)
   	</p>
  	<p>
	 Purposes of the components attached to various locations
     of the locomotive can be sometimes guessed and sometimes
     not.   Although not observable clearly, powered valve gear
     reversers  are equipped  to both engines – it is not practical
     at all to control valve gears mechanically from cabs which
     moves relative to engines at curves.   And there is a cutting
     off of water tank facing to the smoke box.  This is because
     the smoke box door won’t open without it – I realized
     while I was making drawings.

<h2>LNER Class A4 4467 Wild Swan</h2>
</nav>
    <figure><img src="images_A4/CIMG1077.jpg" alt="A4 whole view"></figure>
    <p>
     This is one of the best known steam locomotives not only in Britain but throughout 
	 the world (for enthusiasts at least), particularly her sister locomotive “Mallard” 
	 holds world speed record of 203.4km/h, although German Class 05 also claims 
	 similar speed. However, the beauty of this model may be found in her stream lined 
	 body designed by Sir Nigel Gresley.
     The locomotive was a product of heated competition between the then LNER and 
	 LMS. It was designed for express passenger locomotive
     to serve between London(King’s cross) and Edinburgh'(Waverly) thus equipped by 
	 2032mm driving wheels with three cylinder driving gears, and
     notably by a “corridor tender” which has a narrow passage to the hauled trains 
	 for driving staff change during it’s run,
    
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_A4/A4_1.jpg" alt="A4 pictures"></figure>
	<p>
	 In modeling, the main focus lies how the body line is represented 
	 with formidable three pair of driving wheels. When the original
     locomotive appeared, the driving wheels and front of the cylinder was covered 
	 by a casing so that a straight line is emphasized in level with
     that of the tender. But it was later removed for better maintenance, 
	 revealing her real beauty.
    </p>
	<p>
	The actual structure of the model is far from the original, not only because 
	 the model is driven by electric motors, but also the three
     cylinder structure is completely omitted ( see BR class 18 for comparison). 
	 Yet the model has some contrivance to cope with relatively
     steep curvature of rail that is common in models. The trailing wheel actually 
	 has independent frame from the main one so that the wheel
     has wider freedom of lateral displacement (same as in the case of DB 01 220).
   	</p>
	<p>
	 The corridor tender looked like above. A door at the end of the tender and a small circular
     window for illumination and knuckle/hook coupler. One of the structures still puzzling
     me is the four wheel tender with rigid frame and leaf springs rather than bogies with leaf
     and coil springs. How can it stably operate over 150km/h ? (Not to mention over
     200km/h.)
	</p> 
	<p>
     One of the difficulties in modeling is the painting.
     Unfortunately, I am not talented in painting and I always
     rely on commercially available spray paint and handiwork
     when necessary. Thus, the lines separating black and blue
     livery was drawn manually.
     The silhouette of the body is the result of soldering pieces of brass cut
     and bent, and looks more or less all right.

<h2>du Bousquet 6.024</h2>
</nav>
    <figure><img src="images_du_Bousquet/CIMG0858.jpg" alt="du Bousquet whole view"></figure>
    <p>
     This locomotive is generally referred to “du Bousquet” locomotive after the inventor 
	 Gaston du Bousquet of Nord railways. As seen above, it is a four cylinder compound 
	 locomotive, connecting two engines back to back. The structure looks rather unusual, 
	 but they were not uncommon particularly in France and were found in China as well.
	 Also, the information of this locomotive is easy to find on the Internet, drawings inclusive.
	 Observe that spring is visible in the buffer housing. This was one of the trickiest 
	 points in construction.
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_du_Bousquet/du_Bousquet_1.jpg" alt="du Bousquet both side"></figure>
	<p>
	 “Ceinture” refers to the Grande Ceinture which was an outer circle line of Paris operated 
	 on goods and passenger service. The operator Syndicate de Ceintures was dissolved in 
	 1935 and the locomotives were transferred to Nord railways. The mode of operation 
	 required a machine that could travel in both directions, having enough tractive effort.
     This type of locomotive are classified by an “articulated” locomotive like Garratt or 
	 Bigboy, but the difference is that the two bogies supporting one body - hence 
	 the locomotive cannot be huge in size. In structure, it shares the same idea of
     modern electric locomotives.
    </p>
	<p>
	 Cab window is coverd by a piece of black paper to conseal control circuit inside. Under the
	 cab shows a bit classic driving gear, particularly two bars supporting the cross head.
     Since the size of cylinder is smaller than the front ( say, chimny side is front ) bogie, 
	 this side is equipped wioth high pressure cylinders.
   	</p>
	<p>
	 Coal must have been carried in relatively small space, but the purpose of the locomotive
	 justifies the bunker size, besides it should provide clear rear view for the driver. But it should'nt
	 have been very comfortable for the cabmen.

<h2>BR 18 451</h2>
</nav>
    <figure><img src="images_BR18/CIMG0868.jpg" alt="BR18 whole view"></figure>
    <p>
     This locomotive is one of the masterpieces of German design. Originally designed 
	 for Bayerische Staatsbahnen as express passenger locomotive and has several 
	 variants, the number 451 belongs to a class that has 2000mm driving wheel, and in
     modeling, this should be preferable. Head lights are illuminated by white LEDs, a pity
	 was that the color was bluish white. Incandescent lamp color was not available at
	 the time of construction.
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_BR18/CIMG0872.jpg" alt="BR 18 side view"></figure>
	<p>
	 The looks and style surely justify the machine to be called “one of the most beautiful locomotives”.
     Big elegant driving wheels as well as see through frames matches with a boiler not too 
	 big and stylish chimney. The size of the deflector is just as it should be.
     Steps hanging in front of the deflector is actually longer for the real locomotive, 
	 but in this model it was cut short to provide space to the leading wheels.
    </p>
	<p>
	 The class is a four cylinder compound, meaning that there are two more (smaller) 
	 cylinders inside the frame. In case of modeling, it will be very challenging to build 
	 four cylinder machine - driving wheel shall have cranks, limited space inside the
     frame and so on. However, if one tries to produce this model, these points above 
	 are imperative, particularly, the frame (called bar frame) has a nice visibility to the inside. 
	 ( Reason that I didn’t make class A4 as three cylinder locomotive was that it has plate
     frame through which nothing can be seen.)
     And as anticipated, it turned out to be a most complex locomotive I have ever constructed.

<h2>CFA Garratt BT1</h2>

    <figure><img src="images_CFA/CIMG0753.jpg" alt="CFA BT1 whole view"></figure>
    <p>
     Designed for PLM’s Algerian lines ( Algiers - Oran- Constantine) for express passenger 
	 service. It started operation in 1936.
     However, because of the war, their lives were very sadly short.
     Garratt locomotives are mainly found in Africa, but they are mostly on narrow 
	 gauge (1067mm) and inevitably for mixed services,
     this may be the only standard gauge express Garratt. (AD60 of NSWR is also a 
	 standard gauge Garratt.)
	</p>
	
	<figure><img src="images_CFA/BT1_1.jpg" alt="CFA BT1 front/rear view"></figure>
	<p>
	 Both ends are stream lined and can operate to both direction. The above picture shows 
	 water storage first (this is generally thought to be the front end), but the looks are identical 
	 in both ends.
     </p>
	 <p>
     One of the most interesting features of this locomotive is the Cossart valve gear. 
	 Second driving wheel drives a rod (thick rod with three holes) and eventually rotates 
	 a mechanism to control in/out of steam to the cylinders. Although the same valve gear is
     found on 1-D-1 tank locomotive of Nord railways, the details are difficult to know. 
	 However, very interestingly, there is a patent document (US2064293) by L.R.C.Cossart in 
	 1932 on the Internet by which I was able to understand some part of the mechanism.
	 (Who will be interested about the disclosure of this patent document, but me?)
	 Although the Cossart valve gear claims good characteristics, it seems nice amount 
	 of power is required to drive the valve mechanism if that thick rod is necessary - 
	 was it efficient ?
	</p>
	<p>
	 Complicated link mechanism that is distinctive for this locomotive. It also looks like 
	 that the cab is completely closed. This had been operated in Algeria, couldn't
	 it have been hot ?
